\subsection{Interest from Theorists}

``This measurement was a highlighted need early at JLab. A new measurement at higher $Q^2$ would be very interesting. In principle such could test my model. I could calculate the influence of my 6-quark configurations on elastic scattering."~-G.~Miller

``This measurement is one I've always wanted to see."~-M.~Strikman

``This is an important measurement to know, and should be calculated more thoroughly."~-S.~Liuti

``I'm currently working on a code to compute the quasi-elastic  contribution to inclusive deuteron scattering, which will be the dominant contribution for $x > 1$.  I will of course also be able to compute Azz in this regime with this 
code, so that should be helpful for this proposal. I hope to do some 
calculations soon and could easily do them for the kinematics in your 
proposal."~-W.~Cosyn


In addition, W. van Orden is planning on doing calculations using different nucleon-nucleon potentials, as well as different prescriptions for handling the reactions mechanisms.   These calculations are currently being finalized for the approved
D($e,e'p)n$ at high $Q^2$, high $p_m$ experiment. Once completed, he will turn his attention to tensor polarization observables in the low $Q^2$ region.
